<%# An index page that displays the names of all the artists in your database.
A nice to have feature: On the index page, clicking on the name of the artist would link me to their show page (see below). %>

<h2>Artists</h2>
<ul>
  <%@artists.each do |artist|%>
    <li>
      <a href="/artists/<%=artist.id%>">
        <%= artist.name %>
      </a>
    </li>
  <%end%>
</ul>
